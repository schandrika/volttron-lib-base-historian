VOLTTRON base historian framework that provide common functions such as caching, error handling, input validation etc. This historian cannot be used as agent as is. VOLTTRON historian agents can be created by subclassing the [BaseHistorian class](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-base-historian/blob/develop/src/historian/base/base_historian.py) in this library.

## Requirements

 - Python >= 3.8

## Installation

This library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-base-historian```. However, this is not necessary. Any 
historian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example, 
installing [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install 
volttron-lib-base-historian into the same python environment

## Development

Please see the following helpful guide about [developing modular VOLTTRON agents](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/DEVELOPING_ON_MODULAR.md)
